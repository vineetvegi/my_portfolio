# Install Sass

You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for your operating system from GitHub and adding it to your PATH. That's allâ€”there are no external dependencies and nothing else you need to install.

If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

```
npm install -g sass
```

Once you have Sass installed, you can run the sass executable to compile .sass using

```
npm run sass
```
